# oda-portfolio

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of oda-portfolio is to establish a pipeline with the `{targets}` package
to calculated indicators for all protected areas within countries that received
official development aid by OECD member countries.


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
cat(c("```mermaid", targets::tar_mermaid(), "```"), sep = "\n")
```


To run the pipeline adjust `_targets.R` and `config-oecd-countries.yaml` 
to your local settings and then run the following from a shell:

```shell
$ Rscript -e 'targets::tar_make()'
```
